# Eikon for React

React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4 + animate-ui starter with a feature-first architecture and a portable `.agent/` collaboration protocol that AI coding agents can read directly.

This package is the canonical template consumed by `npx create-eikon-react`. It is also runnable standalone for template authoring and review.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript 5.6+**
- **Vite 6** + **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first config via `@theme`)
- **animate-ui style** components (`motion` + Radix primitives, copy-paste friendly)
- **Zustand** state, **TanStack Query** async data (baseline; always wired)
- **React Router v7**, **React Hook Form** + **zod**
- **i18next** (en/zh) — included by default
- **Supabase** client (optional, `@eikon:feature(supabase)`)
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library** with `__tests__/` colocated per feature
- **ESLint 9 flat config** + **Prettier** with `import/no-restricted-paths` guarding feature boundaries

```

## Conventions enforced by ESLint

- A feature may not import another feature's internals. Cross-feature use must go through `features/<name>/index.ts`.
- `shared/` may never depend on `features/`.
- `app/` only sees a feature through its public `index.ts` / `routes.tsx`.

| `pnpm lint`        | ESLint flat config check                    |
| `pnpm typecheck`   | TypeScript only (no build output)           |

## Working with AI agents

Read [`.agent/README.md`](./.agent/README.md) first — it documents the rule and skill catalogue that any AI agent should consult before making changes.
